## SNU Source Code Plagiarism Detector

Overview
---
The basic idea of the detector is

Source Code --> IR From GCC --> AST --> Caculate Tree Edit Distance --> Judge whether it's plagiarism or not

Graghviz for python3 is required.

Use shelllab
---

```
cd ast_comparator
bash start.sh
```
Check graphviz/plagiarism.pdf. It might take 10~20 minutes.

Use other data
---

Comparision requires `*.tu` file generated by GCC. 
You are supposed to compile the program with `-fdump-translation-unit -fno-builtin -ffreestanding` and place the `*.tu` file under `test/tu`

Then, please put all `*.tu` files under test/tu/
Also, modify test/scope.conf with scopes you would prefer to focus. Please refer to test/scope.conf.example for a good alignment. 

```bash
# Make sure *.tu under test/tu
# Scope added with name of test/scope.conf and formatted similar to test/scope.conf.example
cd  ast_comparator
bash start.sh
```
